                <h2>The Human Behind the Code</h2>
                <p>
                  I'm a full-stack developer based in Walton-on-Thames, UK, who
                  took the scenic route to tech. After successful careers in
                  localization, content management, and graphic design (yes,
                  I've been busy), I finally admitted to myself that I'm
                  happiest when I'm making computers do my bidding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently pursuing a BSc in Computing while working as a
                  Localization Specialist, my journey through multiple
                  industries means I can translate between tech jargon and human
                  language almost as well as I translate between Portuguese and
                  English.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not trying to understand why my code works (or more
                  frequently, why it doesn't), you'll find me cooking elaborate
                  meals, watching football, or explaining to my family why I
                  need "just five more minutes" to fix this one bug.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm a career-changer with skills for problem-solving and a
                  commitment to continuous learning. My unique background gives
                  me a different perspective on development challenges — I don't
                  just build features, I build experiences that make sense to
                  actual humans.

          <div class="about-journey-section-container">
            <div class="journey-section">
              <div class="journey-card">
                <div class="journey-icon">
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i>
                </div>
                <h3>The Past</h3>
                <p>
                  My computing adventure began back in 2000 with a Level III
                  Certificate in Computing where I learned Visual Basic and
                  Delphi. Life had other plans though, and I found myself
                  completing degrees in Journalism and Civil Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After working in content creation and localization, I
                  rediscovered my love for computing and decided it was time for
                  a change. The bootcamp was my first step back, and now there's
                  no stopping me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those weren't wasted years though—they equipped me with
                  analytical thinking, stakeholder management skills, and the
                  ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical people.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="journey-card">
                <div class="journey-icon">
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>
                </div>
                <h3>The Present</h3>
                <p>
                  Currently juggling my BSc in Computing studies with
                  professional work, I'm fully immersed in the world of
                  development. My tech stack includes Next.js, React, Node.js,
                  and I'm adding Java to deepen my programming fundamentals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm passionate about creating clean, user-friendly experiences
                  and writing code that doesn't make other developers want to
                  quit their jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My transition might be taking longer than I'd like (turns out
                  learning to code while working full-time is
                  <em>slightly</em> challenging), but I'm more committed than
                  ever to becoming a professional developer.
