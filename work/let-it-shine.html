          <h2>The Brief (And My Brief Panic)</h2>
          <p class="brief-description">
            A local cleaning company needed a professional website to showcase
            their services and attract new customers. Simple enough, right?
            Well, that was before I realized that making a cleaning website look
            "spotless" while avoiding every cleaning pun in existence would be
            harder than removing red wine from white carpet. The client wanted
            something clean (sorry, couldn't resist), modern, and trustworthy.
            They needed to showcase their services, display testimonials, and
            make it easy for potential customers to contact them. No pressure at
            all. Oh, and did I mention I wasn't just the "developer" on this
            project? I was handed the mop and the blueprint... responsible for
            everything from the initial design sketches to the final deployment.
            Full cycle, full stack, full-on caffeine. If it sparkles, loads
            fast, and looks good on your phone, that's because I handled every
            step (and probably should have made more cleaning jokes along the
            way).

            I kept it simple but effective, sometimes the best solutions are the
            ones that don't require a computer science degree to understand or
            to implement (I am working on that). The project was built using:

          <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Creating a design that felt premium
            without being intimidating. Cleaning services need to feel
            approachable and trustworthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Used a soft color palette with plenty of
            whitespace, cartoonish illustrations and icons, and straightforward
            navigation. Sometimes less really is more.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Making service descriptions engaging
            without being overwhelming. Turns out, there's a lot more to
            cleaning than just "making things clean."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Broke down services into digestible
            sections with clear descriptions. Used icons and visual elements to
            make the information scannable.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section paragraph-spacing">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This project taught me that sometimes the most "simple" projects are
            the most challenging. Creating something that looks effortless
            actually requires quite a bit of effort... kind of like cleaning,
            ironically.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned the importance of understanding your audience. A
            cleaning company's website needs to inspire trust and
            professionalism while remaining approachable. It's not about showing
            off with fancy animations, it's about clearly communicating value
            and reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, I discovered that there are way more cleaning puns
            than I initially thought, and I somehow managed to prevent myself
            from using most of them during development. The client didn't have
            to deal with my humour every single day, surprisingly.
